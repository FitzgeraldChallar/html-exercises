Purpose of the Exercise

This exercise was completed as part of an academic assignment to assess understanding of core web development concepts using HTML and CSS. The objective is to demonstrate the ability to create well-structured web pages and apply appropriate styling techniques without the use of JavaScript or external frameworks.

Overview of the Exercise

The assignment consists of two main parts. The first part focuses on building a homepage featuring interactive numbered blocks that link to different travel destinations using anchor links and nested ordered and unordered lists. The second part involves creating a Travel Stories page that displays travel destinations in a table format, with images of famous attractions linked to detailed sections on the same page. CSS is used throughout the exercise to enhance visual presentation, including hover effects, table styling, image effects, and layout improvements, ensuring clarity, usability, and visual appeal.
